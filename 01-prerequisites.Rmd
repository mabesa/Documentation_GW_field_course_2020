# Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The example code in this documentation can be used (optionally) as base for the completion of the tasks. Students are encouraged to install the software [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical programming [@R-base] and the user interface for R [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) [@RStudio2020]. On-line documentation and tutorials are available for R. This documentation uses the R packages markdown [@R-rmarkdown] and bookdown [@R-bookdown]. Installation of these packages is not required to complete the tasks but students are encourage to try them out. The Rmd code can be viewed any time by clicking on the eye-symbol at the top of the page. All raw data is available via [github](https://github.com/mabesa/Documentation_GW_field_course_2020/tree/master/_bookdown_files/data).
