Students are encouraged to install the software [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical programming [@R-base] and the user interface for R [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) [@RStudio2020]. On-line documentation and tutorials are available for R. This documentation uses the R packages markdown [@R-rmarkdown] and bookdown [@R-bookdown]. Installation of these packages is not required to complete the tasks but students are encourage to try them out.
