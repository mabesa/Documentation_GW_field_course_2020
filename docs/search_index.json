There are two methods which are typically used to measure groundwater pressure: (1) Distance from the well casing to the groundwater table with a dipper and (2) absolute groundwater pressure. In Kappelen, we measure both. 3.1.1 Measurements of distance to groundwater Distance to groundwater is measured with a dipper. Thereby, a weight attached to a measuring tape is lowered to the groundwater table. Low-cost, low-tech analogue dippers are widely used around the world but there are also electrical variants that give a light and/or sound signal when the dipper reachis the water table in the borehole (Figure 3.1). Figure 3.1: Schematic of boreholes in the shallow and deep aquifer layer. Dippers measure the distance from the rim of the borehole pipe to the water level in the borehole. In order to compute distance from the soil surface to the groundwater level, the distance between the rim of the borehole and the soil surface needs to be subtracted. In order to obtain the altitude of the groundwater table, the altitude of the rim of the borehole needs to be known and the distance to the groundwater subtracted (Figure 3.2). Figure 3.2: Schematic of the length measurements taken around a borehole to derive groundwater table. Measurements of distance to groundwater measured by students during the groundwater field course in June 2019 are presented in # Read in depth to groundwater table dGW &lt;- readxl::read_xlsx(&#39;_bookdown_files/data/depth_to_groundwater.xlsx&#39;) knitr::kable( dGW %&gt;% select(-`Sensor cable length [m]`), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Distance to groundwater measured by 4 different student groups.&#39; ) Table 3.1: Distance to groundwater measured by 4 different student groups.

Help: The data is available on github (press “download” or “view raw” and an excel document is downloaded to your computer). 3.1.1.2 Task 2: Calculate the groundwater level Help: The altitude of the rims of the well casings are available on github (press “download” or “view raw” and an excel document is downloaded to your computer). The altitude of the borehole casings is accurate down to approximately 0.5cm. 3.1.1.3 Task 3: Draw a piezometric map of groundwater levels in Kappelen Help: Perform a Kriging interpolation seperately for the two aquifer layers. In R, the package gstat offers a krige routine (Pebesma 2004). 3.1.2 Measurement of absolute pressure The development of the pressure signal in the groundwater is measured with pressure sensors. Commonly, the absolute pressure is measured, i.e. atmospheric pressure plus the pressure of the water column above the sensor. The atmospheric pressure has to be measured above the water table and subtracted from the absolute pressure. From the pressure of the water column above the sensor, a temperature dependent conversion to m of water column is done to derive the height of the water column above the pressure sensor. Finally, to obtain the groundwater level, the length of the sensor cable has to be known (Figure 3.2). In Kappelen, groundwater pressure is monitored continuously in 11 Piezometers, of which 6 sensors send hourly data to the cloud. Figure 3.3 shows the measured groundwater levels in the 6 on-line sensors over time. # Read groundwater pressure data from file P_pressure &lt;- read.csv2(&#39;_bookdown_files/data/groundwater_pressure_mbar.csv&#39;) # Convert Time column to R-readable datetime format P_pressure$Time &lt;- as.POSIXct(P_pressure$Time, format=&#39;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S&#39;, tz=&#39;UTC&#39;) # Make sure pressure is a numeric value P_pressure$Value &lt;- as.numeric(P_pressure$Value) # Read atmospheric pressure from file W_airPressure &lt;- read.csv2(&#39;_bookdown_files/data/weather_station_airPressure_kPa.csv&#39;) # Convert Time column to R-readable datetime format W_airPressure$Time &lt;- as.POSIXct(W_airPressure$Time, format=&#39;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S&#39;, tz=&#39;UTC&#39;) # Make sure pressure is a numeric value W_airPressure$Value &lt;- as.numeric(W_airPressure$Value) * 10 # from kPa to mbar # Aggregate data to daily values P_pressure_daily &lt;- P_pressure %&gt;% mutate(Day = floor_date(Time, unit=&#39;days&#39;)) %&gt;% group_by(Series, Day) %&gt;% summarise(Time = first(Day), Pressure_mbar = mean(Value, na.rm=TRUE)) W_airPressure_daily &lt;- W_airPressure %&gt;% mutate(Day = floor_date(Time, unit=&#39;days&#39;)) %&gt;% group_by(Series, Day) %&gt;% summarise(Time = first(Day), AirPressure_mbar = mean(Value, na.rm=TRUE)) # Calculate pressure of water column above sensor P_pressure_daily &lt;- left_join(P_pressure_daily, W_airPressure_daily %&gt;% select(Day,AirPressure_mbar), by=&#39;Day&#39;) %&gt;% select(-Series.y) %&gt;% drop_na() %&gt;% mutate(PressureWC_mbar = Pressure_mbar - AirPressure_mbar, PressureWC_m = PressureWC_mbar/100) # Rule of thumb: 1bar is approximately 10 m water column # Filter outliers P_pressure_daily$PressureWC_m[P_pressure_daily$PressureWC_m &gt; 10] &lt;- NA P_pressure_daily$PressureWC_m[P_pressure_daily$PressureWC_m &lt; 0.8] &lt;- NA # Calculate altitude of groundwater level P_altitude &lt;- left_join(P_pressure_daily %&gt;% drop_na() %&gt;% mutate(Well=substr(Series.x, nchar(Series.x)-3+1, nchar(Series.x))), dGW %&gt;% select(Well, `Sensor cable length [m]`) %&gt;% mutate(Well=as.character(Well)), by=&#39;Well&#39;) %&gt;% left_join(., coord %&gt;% mutate(Well=substr(`Site Name`, nchar(`Site Name`)-3+1, nchar(`Site Name`))),# %&gt;% # select(`Elevation m a.s.l.`,Well), by=&#39;Well&#39;) %&gt;% mutate(GWlevel_masl=`Elevation m a.s.l.` - `Sensor cable length [m]` + PressureWC_m, Layer=ifelse(sub(&#39;.*(?=.$)&#39;, &#39;&#39;, Well, perl=T)==&#39;1&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;)) P_altitude %&gt;% dplyr::filter(Parameters==&#39;P, T, EC&#39;) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=Day, y=GWlevel_masl, col=Layer, shape=Well), size=0.8) + theme_bw() + labs(y=&#39;Groundwater level [m a.s.l.]&#39;) + scale_color_viridis_d() Figure 3.3: Time series of groundwater levels in the 6 on-line monitoring stations.
