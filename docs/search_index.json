It extends from Kallnach in the south to B\"uren in the north with the Figure 3.1: Hydrogeology of the Seeland aquifer. Figure source: Wasserwirtschaftsamt des Kantons Bern (2004). Translation of the legend: junge Alluviolen: young alluvial soils, Verlandungsböden und feinkörnige Sedimente: fine alluvial sediments, Aareschotter (inkl. junge Alluvionen entlang der alten Aare): Aareschotter (coarse alluvial sediments), Grundmoräne, Moräne: moraine material, Seelandschotter: Seelandschotter (coarse sediments), Molasse, molasse The highest transmissivities of the aquifer are between Kallnach and Lyss (Wasserwirtschaftsamt des Kantons Bern 2004). The IfU groundwater monitoring site lies in a forest between Kappelen and Lyss next to the river Alte Aare (Figure 3.2) where the Aareschotter reaches a thickness of 30m approximately. The research site was established in the late 90ies as a site to research microbial communities in groundwater with high dissolved organic content (Kennedy et al. 2001). 3.2 The Kappelen monitoring site Figure 3.2 shows a map with the locations of the IfU monitoring locations. Figure 3.2: Kappelen site overview. Blue points indicate groundwater monitoring stations, yellow points indicate soil monitoring stations and the green point indicates the pressure sensor in the river Alte Aare. In Kappelen we measure groundwater pressure continuously in 11 boreholes. 6 of the installed sensores, namely 2.1, 3.2, 4.1, 6.1, 6.2, 7.2, measure temperature and electrical conductivity in addition to pressure. A pressure sensor measured changes of river water level in the Alte Aare upstream of the groundwater monitoring site. In two locations, under grass and forest, soil moisture, matric potential and soil temperature are measured. Weather data is collected on grass land close to the groundwater monitoring site. The coordinates of the measurement sites and a list of parameters that are mearued at each site can be downloaded here At the Kappelen site, the aquifer consists of a highly permeable upper aquifer layer and a lower aquifer layer which is partially separated from the uppder aquifer by a semi-permeable layer. At 7 locations, two piezometers have been installed in the shallow and in the deep aquifer each with filtered depths between approximately 5m and 8m and between approximately 10m and 15m. The two different types of boreholes present in Kappelen are shown schematically in Figure 3.3. Figure 3.3: Schematic of boreholes in the shallow and deep aquifer layer. Following common practice in hydrogeology, the boreholes are labeled in ascending order with the boreholes reaching to the oldest geological layers having the lowest suffix numbers. References "],

It is derived from the pressure signal of groundwater. There are two methods which are typically used to monitor groundwater pressure: (1) Measurement of the distance from the well casing to the groundwater table with a dipper and (2) measurement of absolute groundwater pressure. In Kappelen, we measure both. 4.1.1 Measurement of distance to groundwater Distance to groundwater is measured with a dipper. Thereby, a weight attached to a measuring tape is lowered to the groundwater table. Low-cost, low-tech analogue dippers are widely used around the world but there are also electrical variants that give a light and/or sound signal when the dipper reaches the water table in the borehole (Figure 4.1). Common to all dippers is the manual measurement, i.e. the method is suitable for low monitoring frequencies. Figure 4.1: Schematic of boreholes in the shallow and deep aquifer layer. Dippers measure the distance from the rim of the borehole pipe to the water level in the borehole. In order to compute distance from the soil surface to the groundwater level, the distance between the rim of the borehole and the soil surface needs to be subtracted. In order to obtain the altitude of the groundwater table, the altitude of the rim of the borehole needs to be known and the distance to the groundwater subtracted (see Figure 4.2 for an illustration of the different measurements that need to be taken from a borehole in order to be able to compute absolute groundwater levels). Figure 4.2: Schematic of the length measurements taken around a borehole to derive groundwater table. The rim of the borehole does generally not coincide with the groundwater level and needs to be leveled in. The distance to groundwater commonly refers to the distance between the soil surface and the water level measured in the borehole. With a manual dipper, the distance between the rim of the borehole and the groundwater level is measured. Finally, a diver pressure sensor measures the absolute pressure of water and air above the sensor opening and needs to be corrected with measurements of air pressure. Measurements of distance to groundwater measured by students during the groundwater field course in June 2019 are presented in Table 4.1. Table 4.1: Distance to groundwater measured by 4 different student groups.

Task 2: Calculate the groundwater level The altitude of the rims of the well casings are available on here (press “download” or “view raw” and an excel document is downloaded to your computer). The altitude of the borehole casings is accurate down to approximately 0.5cm. Task 3: Draw a piezometric map of groundwater levels in Kappelen Perform a Kriging interpolation separately for the two aquifer layers. In R, the package gstat offers a krige routine (Pebesma 2004). 4.1.2 Measurement of absolute pressure The development of the pressure signal in the groundwater is measured with pressure sensors. Commonly, the absolute pressure is measured, i.e. atmospheric pressure plus the pressure of the water column above the sensor. The atmospheric pressure has to be measured above the water table and subtracted from the absolute pressure. From the pressure of the water column above the sensor, a temperature dependent conversion to meter of water column is done to derive the height of the water column above the pressure sensor. Finally, to obtain the groundwater level, the length of the sensor cable has to be known (Figure 4.2). In Kappelen, groundwater pressure is monitored continuously in 11 Piezometers, of which 6 sensors send hourly data to the cloud. The code below illustrates how to derive groundwater levels from measurements of absolute water pressure and atmospheric pressure. The average daily groundwater levels (computed with the code below) can be downloaded here To reproduce the computations, download the input files here, make sure the packages in Chapter 2 are installed and loaded in your R session, copy paste the code below to your R script and adapt the file paths. # Read groundwater pressure data from files (one file per LoRaWan node).

Figure 4.3: Data measured in piezometer 2.1 prior to data cleaning (right) and posterior to data cleaning (left). Task 4: Temperature-dependent conversion of groundwater pressure to meters of water column The conversion of pressure to meters of water column is temperature dependent. In the above code, the temperature dependence is neglected. Look up the temperature dependency of water and estimate the error that we make if we neglect the temperature-dependency in the pressure conversion in our data from Kappelen. Are there other properties that we measure in Kappelen and that affect the density of water? Note: In the code above we assume that 1 mWC = 98,0665 mbar. This assumption is true for a water temperature of approximately 15°C. 4.2 Temporal evolution of groundater table Figure 4.4 shows the measured groundwater levels in the 6 on-line sensors over time. Figure 4.4: Time series of groundwater levels in the 6 on-line monitoring stations. The groundwater table gradient in the lower aquifer layer is larger than in the upper aquifer layer. The development of the groundwater levels is similar. Task 5: Similarity of time series Verify if the development of the groundwater table in the 6 on-line wells is indeed similar or if there are differences between the wells. Try to explain the differences. Note: The data is available here. 4.3 Temporal evolution of groundwater temperature Figure 4.5 shows the measured temperature in 6 monitoring boreholes in Kappelen. The daily average groundwater temperatures are available here. Figure 4.5: Measured groundwater temperatures at 6 boreholes in Kappelen. Task 6: Discuss the temperature time series Leave out the data from borehole 3.2. Describe the patterns and differences you see in the time series. What could cause these differences? 4.4 Temporal evolution of groundwater electrical conductivity Figure 4.6 shows the measured electrical conductivity in 6 monitoring boreholes in Kappelen. The daily average electrical conductivity in the 6 groundwater monitoring boreholes is available here. Figure 4.6: Measured groundwater temperatures at 6 boreholes in Kappelen. Task 7: Electrical conductivity signals Compare the temperature time series with the time series of electrical conductivity. Can you correlate the two variables? In borehole 4.1 we measured a peak of electrical conductivity in early summer 2019. This peak is not caused by our activity in the groundwater field course (visible as a data gap in early June 2019 in Figure 4.6). Compare the signal of electrical conductivity in borehole 4.1 with the precipitation and river discharge data (kindly provided by the Office of Hydrometrie of the Kanton of Berne). Task 8: Conclusion Write a conclusion of what you learned in this chapter. References "],

The groundwater table was at 3.75m below the rim of the borehole. The screened section of the borehole is between 9.5m and 14.5m below the rim. The diameter of the borehole is 10.5cm. The flowmeter was moved at a constant speed of 7m/s for the experiments labeled ‘Continuous measurement’ or ‘Continuous meas.’ in Figure 5.1. In a second experiment, point measurements were taken at intervals of 50cm (labeled ‘Point measurement’ or ‘Point meas.’ in Figure 5.1). The data for the task is available here. Figure 5.1: Data set of the flow meter test in borehole 6.1. cont and point indicate continuous lowering &amp; rising of the flow meter and point measurements at defined depths respectively under non-pumping conditions. Task 10: Evaluate flow meter test Follow the steps in (Molz et al. 1989) to determine flow velocities and hydaulic conductivities along the borehole. 5.2 Dilution test Figure 5.2 shows the electrical conductivity and temperature measured during a dilution test in borehole 4.2. The water in the well was mixed using a small submersible pump. 150g of NaCl was dissolved in water and the solution injected continuously into the borehole within one turn-over time, i.e. the time it takes for the water in the well to circulate through the pumps pipes. During the dilution tests, groundwater was continuously pumped from well 4.1 (for the tracer test). The data is available here. Figure 5.2: Data set 1 of the dilution test in borehole 4.2. Dilution test 2 was performed in borehole 3.2 (Figure 5.3). Note, 2 dilution curves are in the input file. A solution of 90g of NaCl was added from a Mariotte’s bottle to borehole 3.2 over the duration of 95 seconds. Use the second curve starting at 14:30! The data is available here.

Sensors measured pressure and temperature in boreholes 3.1 and 3.2. The volume of the cylindrical slug object is 0.013 m3. 6 slug tests were performed: 3 fast ones where the slug volume was lowered and pulled out again quickly and 3 slow ones where the slug volume was entered and pulled out over a time interval of approximately 7 seconds. The data from these 6 consecutive experiments is shown in Figure 5.4. The data is available here. Figure 5.4: Data set 1 of the slug test in borehole 3.2.

Task 13: Estimate S and K using Butler’s method Choose one of the 3 data sets and estimate aquifer storativity and hydraulic conductivity sing Butler’s method (Butler Jr, Garnett, and M. 2003). 5.4 Pumping test Pressure was measured in boreholes 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2 and 8.1 with measurement intervals of 0.2s. Water was pumped from borehole 2.1 for 20 minutes and then turned off and recovery of the groundwater table was monitored for another 20 minutes. During the pumping test, groundwater was continuously pumped from well 4.1 for the tracer test experiment. Figure 5.7 shows an overview over the experimental setup. Figure 5.7: Setup of the pumping tests during field course 2019. Drawing by Baume, Gardenghi, Formakova, Huber and Cracknell. Since the times on the field laptops were not synchronized, the starting times of the pressure time series are not consistent. A spatial analysis of the pumping test thus cannot be done. The data presented in Figure 5.8 is available here. Alternatively, the raw pressure data for the pumping test can be downloaded here (all files starting with “pumping_test”). We recommend to use the code producing Figure 5.8 as a starting point for the tasks. The code can be viewed by clicking on the eye icon at the top of the page. Figure 5.8: Pressure signals measured at 7 sites during the pumping test. Task 14: Derive aquifer parameters Estimate the aquifer parameters based on the methods by Jacob and Walton described in Kruseman and de Ridder (2000) and discuss if the aquifer is confined or unconfined in the surroundings of borehole 2.1 and if steady state conditions were reached during the pumping test. 5.5 Tracer test The tracer tests was started on June 4th at 7p.m.. 100g of uranine tracer were diluted in 1000l of water and pumped to borehole 1.1. A pump in borehole 4.1 was running at a constant rate of 0.0052 m3/s for 3 days and uranine concentrations were sampled continuously (every 10 seconds) using a GGUN-FL Fluorometer (Schnegg and Doerfliger 1997) (Figure 5.9) and manually at a 2-3 hours interval (Figure 5.10). The data measured by the Fluorometer is available here and the calibrated concentrations from the manual uranine samples are available here. Figure 5.9: Tracer signal in measured by the GGUN-FL Fluorometer. The turbidity signal is given in cyan color. Figure 5.10: Manually measured uranine breakthrough curve at well 4.1. Task 15: Calibrate the fluorometer data Calibrate the fluorometer data using the calibration data provided on github and compare the two breakthrough curves. Use the fluorometer data labeled ‘Tracer 1’. Task 16: Simulate the tracer test usind FeFlow Task description by Andres? References "],

Figure 6.1: Matric potential, soil temperature and soil water content measured at 2-3 depths at the field station in Kappelen. Figure 6.2: Matric potential, soil temperature and soil water content measured at 2-3 depths at the field station in Kappelen. The sensor measuring water content at 10cm depth in the forest is not working any longer and not displayed here. If you decide to work with the raw data, do not include this sensor in your analysis. The data for the field station is available here and the data for the forest station is available here. Task 17: Derive a soil-characteristic curve Use the data linked above to derive soil-characteristic curves for both stations (field and forest). 6.2 Soil infiltration capacity Double ring infiltration experiments were done on both, forest and grass soils (Figure 6.3). The data presented in Figure 6.3 is available here. Figure 6.3: 3 data sets of soil infiltration data collected on forest and grass ground in Kappelen. Task 18: Saturated hydraulic conductivity Calculate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil under grass and forest soil. 6.3 Aquifer recharge from precipitation The daily weather data from the station in Kappelen in given in Figure 6.4.
